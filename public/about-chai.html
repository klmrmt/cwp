      <p>My name is Sanjay and I am a fan of Indian Art House Cinema (also referred to as Alternative Indian
Cinema, Parallel Indian Cinema, and Independent Indian Cinema). I also enjoy watching commercial
Indian movies, Indian TV Series, English TV Series and relevant Documentaries.
I wanted to share some information with individuals who have a particular interest in Indian Art House
Cinema and Documentaries (and to some extent commercial TV and Cinema). Over the last 30
years or so I have compiled a list of Titles that largely reflect Indian Art House Cinema and
Documentaries. I have been accumulating this information from various sources (Newspaper
clippings, Film Festivals that I have attended or researched, IMDb, etc.). I finally have had some time
to compile this information and launch it on my new website ChaiWithPapa.com. I have watched
and rated some of the Titles, but there are many that I have either not had the time to watch yet or I
cannot locate a source to view the movie. Many of these Titles reflect my own favorite actors,
directors and subject matter. I have a particular affinity for movies that are low budget, rural based
and touch on socially relevant topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not claim to be a film critic nor am I very knowledgeable of Indian Art House Cinema. I do, however, know that I am passionate about watching these movies and hence wanted to share my collections/research with all who have an interest in this fascinating world of Indian parallel cinema.  Typically, these movies are not made for commercial gain and that limits the commercial availability of these movies. However, in recent years many streaming platforms (Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. ) have started including them. Recently Cinemapreneur.com was launched that focuses on screening Indian Independent cinema. I commend all the Producers, Directors, Writers and Actors who have made this genre available to us and also to the Film Festivals and streaming platforms that showcase these movies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would also like to make this listing as comprehensive as possible and to that extent I would appreciate it if you would pass along any Indian Art House Cinema Alternate Movies/Documentaries/Short Films that would make this collection more valuable to all.  Please note that in cleansing this large data, some of the information may be incomplete and inaccurate. Please notify me if you identify such inaccuracies or can furnish any missing data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please pass on this message only to individuals that have an interest in this subject matter. This is a personal passion project for me, and I hope that comes through as you are having Chai and browsing my website. Please contact me for any additional information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoping to Chai with you someday!<br>
